# Body-Fat-Percentage-Prediction-using-linear-regression

Bodyfat-Percentage.csv dataset contains estimates for the percentage of a body fat
determined by underwater weighting and various body circumference measurements for
252 men. Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient and costly therefore its
desirable to have an easy methods of estimating body fat.

The dataset consist of the following columns:

 Density determined from underwater weighing

 Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation

 Age (years)

 Weight (lbs)

 Height (inches)

 Neck circumference (cm)

 Chest circumference (cm)

 Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)

 Hip circumference (cm)

 Thigh circumference (cm)

 Knee circumference (cm)

 Ankle circumference (cm)

 Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)

 Forearm circumference (cm)

 Wrist circumference (cm)

it’s required to do the following:

1. Randomly select 10% of the dataset records and save them into BodyfatPercentage-Test-Data.csv file

2. Design and Implement a ML algorithm to predict the body fat percentage from
density, age, weight, height, neck circumference, chest circumference, abdomen 2
circumference, hip circumference, thigh circumference, knee circumference, ankle
circumference, biceps circumference, forearm circumference and wrist
circumference.

3. Use the extracted Test data records from Step 1 to test your implemented algorithm.
